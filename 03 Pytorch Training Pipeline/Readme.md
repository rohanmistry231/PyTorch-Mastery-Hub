# 03 PyTorch Training Pipeline

Welcome to the **PyTorch Training Pipeline** section! This folder contains a Jupyter notebook outlining the essential steps for building and training models in PyTorch.

## üì¶ What is a Training Pipeline?
A training pipeline in PyTorch is a structured process for training machine learning models. It includes data preparation, model definition, loss computation, optimization, and evaluation.

## üöÄ Topics Covered

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loading datasets using `torchvision.datasets`
   - Using `DataLoader` for batch processing

2. **Model Definition**
   - Creating models using `torch.nn.Module`
   - Defining layers and forward passes

3. **Loss Function**
   - Common loss functions: `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, `MSELoss`, etc.
   - Calculating loss to measure model performance

4. **Optimization**
   - Initializing optimizers: `torch.optim.SGD`, `Adam`, etc.
   - Adjusting learning rates

5. **Training Loop**
   - Forward pass: computing predictions
   - Backward pass: calculating gradients with `loss.backward()`
   - Optimizing weights with `optimizer.step()`
   - Zeroing gradients using `optimizer.zero_grad()`

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Switching to evaluation mode with `model.eval()`
   - Disabling gradient computation with `torch.no_grad()`

7. **Visualization**
   - Tracking loss and accuracy using libraries like Matplotlib

## üèéÔ∏è Running the Notebook

1. Ensure PyTorch is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the **Pytorch Training Pipeline** notebook and start building your training workflow!

## üî• Why Learn the Training Pipeline?
Mastering the training pipeline is crucial for:
- Structuring model training efficiently
- Understanding core concepts like backpropagation and optimization
- Preparing for real-world machine learning projects
