# 11 Transfer Learning using PyTorch

Welcome to the **Transfer Learning using PyTorch** section! This folder contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to leverage pre-trained models for image classification tasks, using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## üî• What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model (usually trained on a large dataset like ImageNet) is fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This reduces training time and improves model performance by utilizing learned features from the base model.

## üöÄ Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Transfer Learning**
   - The concept of transfer learning
   - Benefits of using pre-trained models

2. **Loading Pre-trained Models**
   - Using models from `torchvision.models` (e.g., ResNet, VGG)
   - Freezing and unfreezing layers for fine-tuning

3. **Feature Extraction vs Fine-tuning**
   - **Feature Extraction**: Freeze all layers except the final classifier
   - **Fine-tuning**: Unfreeze some layers to allow further training

4. **Modifying the Classifier Layer**
   - Replacing the final layer of pre-trained models with custom layers using `nn.Linear`
   - Matching output classes for Fashion MNIST

5. **Training the Model**
   - Using GPU acceleration (`model.to(device)`)
   - Implementing a training loop with:
     - Forward pass
     - Loss calculation (`CrossEntropyLoss`)
     - Backpropagation and optimization (`torch.optim.Adam`)

6. **Evaluating Model Performance**
   - Calculating accuracy and loss
   - Visualizing predictions

7. **Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna**
   - Integrating Optuna for automated hyperparameter tuning
   - Defining the objective function to optimize learning rates, batch sizes, etc.

## üèéÔ∏è Running the Notebooks

1. Ensure PyTorch, torchvision, and Optuna are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision optuna
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the following notebooks:
   - **transfer_learning_fashion_mnist_pytorch_gpu.ipynb**: Basic transfer learning
   - **cnn_optuna.ipynb**: Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
